## Towards a workflow for operational mapping of *Aedes aegypti* at urban scale based on remote sensing

This repo holds the scripts that we have developed towards an operational workflow for mapping dengue vectors in urban areas. The scripts were originally developed using SPOT imagery as input, but these can be replaced by Sentinel 2 level 2A data in order to avoid the atmospheric correction step and automatize the ingest of satellite data.
